# python-api-challenge_6

In this challenge we were focused on "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" and finding a hotel for our next vacation using Python requests, APIs, and JSON.
WeatherPy is a Python program that helps to find the perfect travel destinations based on weather conditions. It uses data from OpenWeatherMap to generate a list of potential vacation spots. You can customize your search by setting temperature preferences, humidity levels, and more. WeatherPy then provides you with a list of cities that match your criteria, making it easier to plan your next getaway. It's a handy tool for travelers who want to ensure they have pleasant weather during their trips.

VacationPy is a companion program to WeatherPy that takes your list of preferred vacation destinations and helps you plan your trip. It uses data from the Google Places API to find nearby hotels, restaurants, and other points of interest in each city. VacationPy provides you with a map that displays all these locations, making it convenient to plan your itinerary.
